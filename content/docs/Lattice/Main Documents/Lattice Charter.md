# THE CHARTER OF THE LATTICE COOPERATIVE

**As Ratified by the First Convenor, Mayaafox**

## PREAMBLE

We, the Members of the Lattice Cooperative (hereby referred to as 'The Lattice'), united by a shared belief in collaboration, community uplift, and interregional harmony, do hereby establish this Charter as the foundational law of our organization.

The Lattice exists as a civic, cultural, and infrastructural network operating across the territories of multiple nations with their consent. We are not a state, and we do not seek sovereignty; instead, we act as a distributed web of autonomous Nodes, small settlements, embassies, or community centers, embedded within host nations and aligned with their laws.

Through this Charter, we affirm our mission to support new players, facilitate international (InterCiv) cooperation, promote infrastructure and knowledge sharing, and build a more interconnected CivMC.

## SECTION I - NATURE AND STATUS OF THE LATTICE

### 1.1 – Non-Sovereign Status

The Lattice Cooperative is a non-state, non-military, non-territorial civic organization. It does not claim borders, sovereignty, or independent jurisdiction.

### 1.2 – Nodes as Autonomous Territories

Lattice Nodes are parcels of land located within a host nation, with full permission and agreement of that nation.

A Node:
1. Is internally administered by the Lattice.
2. Is externally subject to the laws, customs, and sovereignty of its host nation.
3. Functions similarly to an embassy, cultural center, or autonomous civic district.
4. May be revoked, relocated, or renegotiated by either party.

### 1.3 – Purpose of Nodes

Nodes exist to:
- Provide safe havens for newfriends.
- Serve as training, building, and cultural hubs
- Support affiliated or developing towns
- Host educational or infrastructure programs
- Connect multiple communities through Lattice programming
- Store Lattice resources

### 1.4 – Diplomatic Framework

1. All Nodes require mutual agreement between the Lattice and the hosting nation.
2. Nodes must not violate or circumvent national law.
3. The Lattice may negotiate operational privileges, but must always remain subordinate to host authority.
4. Nodes may not be militarized or fortified beyond what is necessary for peaceful civic purposes.

## SECTION II - MEMBERSHIP AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE

### 2.1 - Status Groups Within the Cooperative

The Lattice recognizes two categories of participants:

#### A. Members (Internal Body)

Members are the fully initiated individuals who participate in the internal governance, operations, planning, and administration of the Cooperative.

Members have access to:
- Internal decision-making
- Strategic discussions
- Node oversight
- Sensitive or diplomatic information
- Lattice-wide voting and amendment proposals

Members form the core operational body of the Cooperative.

#### B. Allies (External but Empowered Contributors)

Allies are non-member individuals or representatives of nations/towns who formally collaborate with the Lattice.

An Ally may:
- Assist in Lattice programs
- Help operate Nodes (when permitted)
- Participate in cooperative events
- Contribute to large-scale projects
- Host Lattice Nodes within their nation
- Coordinate diplomacy or logistics with Lattice staff

However, Allies:
- Do not vote on internal Lattice decisions

Allies form the external cooperative network through which the Lattice interfaces with the world.

### 2.2 - Eligibility and Admission

#### Membership Admission

Individuals may become Members only by:
1. Nomination by an existing Member or Weaver,
2. Vetting for trustworthiness, alignment with values, and reliability,
3. Final assent by the Convenor.

Membership is selective to preserve safety, cohesion, and organizational integrity.

#### Ally Admission

A person or group becomes an Ally when:
- They enter into a formal cooperative relationship with the Lattice, OR
- Their nation hosts a Node, OR
- They participate in mutually agreed programs or objectives.

Nations may become Allies, but this does not grant Member status to their citizens.
