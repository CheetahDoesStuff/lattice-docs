# What you need to write

You will need the following to write to the lattice docs:
* A github account
* A web browser

Yes, its that simple!

# Getting started

Writing to the docs may seem hard, but its actually pretty easy!
Lets start with writing to an already existing page.

all pages are written in the markdown syntax, aka different characters create different output on the page, for example *italic text* or **bold text**.

A great resource to learn the syntax is [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
Note that this website doesnt cover everything, but because of the popularity of markdown its really easy to google up syntax for different stuff, like links!

# Where do i write?

This is where the github accounts come in!

The source "code" (the markdown files)
